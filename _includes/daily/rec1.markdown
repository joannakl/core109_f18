You will start working with Colaboratory and Jupyter notebooks today.

Colabolatory = working in the cloud, no need to install anything on your own machine, access to the
files on your NYU Google drive whenever/wherever you are.

Jupyter = we can work with math problems, solutions, implementation, visualization of results all in one file.

[Lab 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19OvmIWwrXDmK2X7wG_KDJ8Kzp6dyQ-XD/view?usp=sharing)

- Follow the link to Lab 1. It will open a shared document that you can view only.
- Go to `File` and select `Save a Copy in Drive`. Now you have your own copy that you can edit.
- Follow the instructions in the file to run the programs embedded in that file and
answer the questions for each problem.
- Once you are finished working (i.e., all problems are solved/answered), download the copy of the file to
your own computer. Go to `File` and select `Download .ipynb`. <br>
There are two reasons for this step: 1) you have your own backup copy, 2) you need to submit that file
to NYU Classes so the graders can access it.
