Problem 1:

Good job.

Problem 2: 

The calculation of the ratios is not correct (-5). 
The program calculates the (x+1)/x where x is the term
number, instead of x/(x+1). 
The term compare_ratios should be 1, not zero, to indicate
that the ratio of the two consecutive fibonacci numbers
is equal to the golden ratio. 

Problem 3: 

Good job.
