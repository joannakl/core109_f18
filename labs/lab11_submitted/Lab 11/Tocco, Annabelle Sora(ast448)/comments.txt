Problem 1:

Good job. But the percentage change was supposed to be 
calculated by the program not calculated elswhere and just
printed by your code. 

Problem 2: 

The answer seems to be missing for this problem. 
The little code that is there is not correct.
(-30) 



Problem 3: 

This program has a lot of errors. The only part that works is the part that
prints the hard-coded values of the percentage change in prices.
