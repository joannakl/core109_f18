Problem 1:

Nice work. 

Problem 2: 

Good job.  

Problem 3: 

The plot of the data is missing (-5). 
The percentage increase was supposed to be calculated
based on the fares and the changes in price of the fares. 
The inflation rate does not come into play for the third part.
When a price is 0.05 and then goes up to 0.10, the precentage
increase is 100%. (-20)
