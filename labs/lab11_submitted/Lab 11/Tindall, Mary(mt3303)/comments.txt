Problem 1:

Good job, although the percentages are not calculated correctly. 

Problem 2: 

The ratios are not calculated and there is no discussion
comparing the fibonacci number ratios to the golden ratio. (-25) 


Problem 3: 

The percentage increase is not computed correctly. (-5)
When a price is 0.05 and then goes up to 0.10, the precentage
increase is 100%.
