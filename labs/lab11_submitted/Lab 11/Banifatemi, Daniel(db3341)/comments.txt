Problem 1:

Nice work, but the average of the nests per female is closer
to 5.5, not 5. 

Problem 2: 

The program prints the ratios of Fibonacci numbers and the golder ratio.
But it does not really provide any comparison/discussion about them. 

Problem 3: 

The plot of the data is missing (-5). The plot is created but never
displayed with plt.show(). 
The parts two and three of the question seem to be mixed up together and
the answer does not really make much sense. (-20)
