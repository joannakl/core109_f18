Problem 1:

The plot does not contain correct data. The number of nests
and female turtles should be plotted against the years (x-axis). (-10)
The percentage increase is not computed correctly. 


Problem 2: 

Good job. 

Problem 3: 

The percentage increase is not computed correctly. (-10)
When a price is 0.05 and then goes up to 0.10, the precentage increase is 100%. 
The question about inflation is not answered (-5). 

Good job on the plot.
