Problem 1:

Nice work.

Problem 2: 

Good job on calculation of the ratios, but there is no
discussion there comparing the ratio to the golden ratio (-3)

Problem 3: 

The percentage increase is not computed correctly. (-10)
When a price is 0.05 and then goes up to 0.10, the precentage
increase is 100%. 
Good job on the plot.
