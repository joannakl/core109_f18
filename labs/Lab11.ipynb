    "Leatherback Sea Turtle population is declining due to many reasons. The paper published in 2013 [Long‚Äêterm decline of the western Pacific leatherback, Dermochelys coriacea: a globally important sea turtle population](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/ES12-00348.1#i2150-8925-4-2-art25-Hitipeuw1) contains information about the estimated counts of nests and female leatherbacks in Jamursba Medi.\n",
    "Your job for this problem is to use this data to calculate a few things:\n",
    "- The female turtles lay eggs in multiple nests. What is the approximate number of nests in which a single female lays eggs? How did you estimate this? \n",
    "- What is the percentage by which the number of nests differs in each year from the previous year (assume that the previous year is 100%, calculate the percentage increase/decrease for the next year)? Write a program that shows the table.\n",
    "What is the average percentage change? Is it a decrease or increase on average? Explain how you calculated it. \n",

For example, the fare was 5 cents from 1905 to 1948, this means that your plot should have a flat line for these years and then the increase in 1948 to 10 cents. \n",
