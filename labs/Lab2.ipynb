    "## Problem 1: ASCII Art\n",
    "\n",

    "\"ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for \n",
    "presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable \n",
    "characters defined by the ASCII Standard.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So ASCII art is a way of producing a \"drawing\" using characters. \n",

    "       /\\\n",
    "       \"\"\n",
    "      /\"\"\\ \n",
    "      \"\"\"\"\n",
    "     /\"\"\"\"\\\n",
    "     \"\"\"\"\"\" \n",

    " \n",
    "Write a program that uses the `print()` function multiple times to produce \n",
    "a simple ASCII art graphic. \n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: do not spend too much time coming up with a fancy design!\n",
    "(this tends to be addictive, and you have a few other problems to work on). If you do not have any creative ideas, you can write a program that prints the above tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "REMEMBER 1: You need to actually write a program that produces a graphic. Do not simply create an ASCII graphic by entering characters like we did in the example above. \n",
    "\n",
    "REMEMBER 2: Python has some special characters that need escape sequences to appear in the result.\n",
    "For example, to produce a double quote in your output, you have two options: 1), use a string with a single quote delimeter, 2) use the `\\\"` escape sequence. \n",
